## **Introduction**

The Product Management System (PMS) is a Spring Boot application designed to help manage products efficiently. It features a RESTful API, database integration, and an innovative binary tree structure for product categorization and retrieval.

---

## **Features**
- Add, update, delete, and search products.
- Binary tree implementation for efficient categorization.
- Multiple profiles (Development and Production) for flexible deployment.
- API documentation using Swagger.
- Modular and scalable architecture.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (REST API, Spring Data JPA)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Binary Tree:** Custom implementation in Java
- **Tools:** Maven, IntelliJ IDEA

## **Binary Tree Integration**

The application uses a custom binary tree structure for product categorization. The tree supports:
- **Deletion:** Products are efficiently removed while maintaining tree integrity.
- **Search:** Quick lookup by product name.

The binary tree is populated during application startup using data from the database (`@PostConstruct`).
